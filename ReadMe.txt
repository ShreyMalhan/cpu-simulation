********************************Compiling and Running Code**********************************
To compile the code type: make all

**NOTE**: When I shifted all my code to aviary, I had to redo the tabs in the makefile.
        If the code doesn't compile and gives an error like: makefile missing separator. stop, then in the makefile, under all: and test:
        press the tab once.

To run the code: ./A2 yourFileName.txt

*********************************Compiling and Running tests**********************************
To compile the tests type: make test

To run the tests type: ./Test
